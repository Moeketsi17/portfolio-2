As a self-taught, hands-on developer, I have mastered tools and technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Git, WordPress, PHP, Python, Django, and the Adobe design suite. My combined design background and technical expertise enable me to deliver user-centric solutions while working collaboratively with cross-functional teams.",
